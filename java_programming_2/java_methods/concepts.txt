JAVA METHODS:

java methods are block of code that perform a specific task. A method allows us to reuse code, Improving both efficiency and organization.
All methods in java must belong to a class. Methods are similar to functions and expose the behavior of objects.

KEY COMPONENTS OF METHODS:
Methods consist of modifier (Define Access Level), return type (What value returned or void), 
name (Define the name of method follows camelCase), parameters (optional inputs), and a body.

WHY USE METHODS?
Break code into separate methods helps improve readability, reusability, and maintainability.

METHOD CALL STACK IN JAVA
java is an object-oriented and stack-based programming language where methods play a key role in controlling the program's execution flow.
When a method is called java uses an internal structure known as the call stack to manage execution, variables, and return addresses.

WHAT IS A CALL STACK?
The call stack is a data structure used by the program during runtime to manage method calls and local variables. it operates in a Last-in-first-Out (FIFO) manner.
Meaning the last method called is the first one to complete and exit.

HOW ARE METHODS EXECUTED?
1. A new stack frame is added to the call stack to store the method details.
2. The methods runs its code.
3. After execution, the stack frame is removed, and control goes back to the calling method.

Java automatically manages the call stack using the JAVA Virtual MAchine (JVM).
